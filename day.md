# My day
*Now i'm working at Uncle Harry overnight as a baker to support my life, so my schedule is really weird*
### My day begin at 3 p.m everyday!
1. I like to start my day with a warm honey lemon water cup after I waked up. 
2. 4 p.m I would like to teach my little sister how to write and spell her name, because she going to kindergaten on September.
3. Then I like to run around my neiborhood for few minutes to warm up my body.(working overnight is very harmful, and sleepy, I cannot learn if I don't do a little warm up)
4. After that, I start learning or doing some assginment. 
5. 8 to 9 is my freetime, so I like to watch TV shows or reading commic or chatting with my friends
6. I start to work at 10 p.m to 7 a.m

This is my typical day. How about your day?
